⚔️ Project Origins: The GOODLUMS began way before bitcoin ever existed, originally created by NORMANCOMICS(@KEKBONDS) back in the late 1990's, and have morphed from ink on paper, to paint on buildings, trains, bridges & rooftops, from there... The Goodlums somehow found their way back indoors in gallery shows & on skateboard decks for indie skate companies. They've been tattooed on numerous ex-girlfriends, tagged on surfaces across the USA & adorned everything from skateboard decks to album covers and renowned Galleries that represent artists which operate in a different world than their creator, NORMANCOMICS, who prefers they stay in the sub-sub-sub-cultures. During Covid, when others were scamming social security and hoarding toilet-paper, NORMANCOMICS was busy learning about minting art on the blockchain. Once he c-walked his way over to web9 and discovered the seedy underworld of the NFT world & learned all about wash-trading, pumping & dumping & exit liquidity... The Goodlums Launched on ETH, expanded to BITCOIN VIA COUNTERPARTY($XCP) & BTC STAMPS & THEN MADE IT’S WAY TO BASE & DEGEN, until The Goodlums discovered $DMT was MORE BASED Than Base & It’s users were real degens. Secret Spin-off tokens/etc minted on hidden chains to be discovered by users.
