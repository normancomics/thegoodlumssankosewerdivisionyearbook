## üí∏ ~~Multi-Currency Minting on the Sanko Chain~~

~~The Goodlums Sanko Sewer Division Yearbook collection introduces a unique **multi-currency minting system**, allowing users to mint exclusive, yield-bearing PFPs using various gang-affiliated currencies on Sanko Chain alongside the primary currency, **$DMT**. This flexibility enhances accessibility, empowering users to engage with the collection through the currency of their choice.~~

> ~~**Note:** Prices for gang-related currencies are subject to change due to market fluctuations and gang-related taxation.~~

## ‚öîÔ∏è Project Origins

The GOODLUMS began before the blockchain ever existed, originally created by NORMANCOMICS (@KEKBONDS) in the late 1990s. They've evolved from ink on paper to paint on buildings, trains, bridges & rooftops, eventually making their way to gallery shows, skate-decks for indieüõπcompanies, tattoos(primarily on ex-gf's), underground hip-hop, punk album covers & more.

With the discovery of **web9**, the project launched on Ethereum, expanded to Bitcoin via Counterparty ($XCP) and BTC Stamps, then made its way to Base and Degen. Finally, the GOODLUMS found a home on **Sanko Chain ($DMT)**, attracting a community of true degens. Additional hidden spin-off tokens and assets are minted on undisclosed chains, awaiting discovery by dedicated users.
